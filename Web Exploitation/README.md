## Instances (Without Shoot The SQL)

- Let Him Cook: http://localhost:1337

- Totally Not E-learning: http://localhost:1338

>One of the courses in my e-learning is locked because I didn't pass Network Communication last semester. Hmm, I've heard that you are good at web exploitation. Can you find out the content of the locked course?

- Pressure: http://localhost:1339

>A fresh intern at Dell Company was tasked with creating their first login page under intense pressure from management. While they succeeded in making it look professional with fancy animations and modern design, their JavaScript code looks like it went through a blender full of random characters, strange encoding, and some questionable choices for hiding sensitive data.

- Leaky Vault: http://localhost:1342

>A junior developer's first "secure" vault website just went live, proudly serving confidential documents through their "advanced" PHP file handling system. The way they manage document retrieval paths seems... interesting. Can you try to read the source code of the website?

## Shoot The SQL
